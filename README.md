## Introduction
The application's original private repository has been reuploaded. We initially used branching to implement the real team workflow: front-end & back-end branches. 
This is a prototype of the application for analysis and management of banking operations.
The back end part of the application makes a request to fetch data from the open API registry and then passes all the data to the front end part to visualise.
The open API registry has been provided by VTB for each team in order to make requests.
## Visual layout
This is the layout for an initial prototype version.

## Application goals
To analyse operations, user data for offering services, reporting suspicious transactions, etc. based on open API.
The application may be developed further on.
